- 👋 Hi, I’m @KABRIGAN
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ programming
- 🌱 I'm currently in 11th grade at school

- 💞️ Looking for collaboration on any C++ projects. 
I'm just starting out and I can say that I'm very inexperienced, plus my English isn't great since I'm from Ukraine. 
I'd appreciate any advice on C++ programming and in general, recommendations on books, articles to read, things to watch, 
good websites for solving simple tasks, and so on. Any guidance would be welcomed.

- 📫 How to contact me I’m new to GitHub, if this is possible, please write to me in a personal message on GitHub or here’s my Instagram

- ⚡ Fun fact:I do bodybuilding and rarely play Dota 2.
